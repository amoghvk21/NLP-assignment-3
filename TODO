- None for initial_guesses and continue_training
- check train_EM_log()
- HMMClasifier.viterbi() and viterbi_log() indexing 
    e.g. -1 or not in optimal_path.append()
    lots of other indexing issues

- map_tags() inner function in test_kmeans() function in kmeans_pipeline
- need to understand subword pooling in generate_bert_embeddings()

- Need to make sure i am minimising for loops and use matricies
    - Esp in viterbi - there is a triple for loop

- go through viterbi_log and use this to implement viterbi (both in hmm.py)

- num_clusters

- remove all alpha and betas
